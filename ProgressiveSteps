My notes for script to clean up files when I have folders with a lot of variable data in them. (eg: information requests from social media)

Problems to solve:

User musts:
User must be able to select the folder they want to clean up
User must specify where they want the job to move the files to
User must specify how long the backups should be retained for

Script musts:
Script must feed back consistent progress to the user
Script must have a clear definition of which file types can be moved and which cannot
Script must organise files based on the year they were first created
Script must not delete any files that it does not recognise
Script must create a zipped (and compressed) copy of all files interacted with to ensure bnackup in the event of failure
Script must assign a each backup with a unique identifier (hash value)
Script must adhere to the backup retention policy and delete when deadline has been reached

Blue-sky project
Script should use facial recognition to identify and categorise people's faces
Script should identify duplicate files and remove them
Script should run when prompted or regularly in commonly set folders (set by the user)
